LaTex Template for UMass Medical School GSBS Thesis Preparation

## Getting Started Writing Your Thesis

### On the Internet

The quickest and easiest way to get started it to go to [overleaf.com](http://overlead.com) and load the UMass Template...

### On your own computer

#### Mac OSX

1. Install MacTeX


#### Windows

1. dunno

#### Linux

1. You can figure it out :)

## features

#### Plain text Writing:

You no longer have to fiddle around with Microsoft Word styles or macros or anything. Just open up a standard text editor (notepad, etc) and start writing. We like [TextWrangler]() or [Atom]() both of which are free.

#### Automagical formatting

Once you compile your document LaTeX will Automagically calculate your section numbers, fill in your Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables, and Bibliography. No more worry about updating your Table of Contents after editing something, or struggling to keep Microsoft Word's codefields happy.

LaTeX uses one of the most advanced typesetting programs (TeX) to typeset your thesis. What this means exactly is during compilation, LaTeX is figuring out how best to arrange words to create some of the most beautiful, fully-justified text you will ever find. Leaps and bounds above the standard full-justification available in Word, LaTeX, factors in automatic word hyphenation, and kerning adjustments, in additional to intra-word space on a line-by-line basis in order to ensure the most uniform text layout, which results in a overall pleasant reading experience (happy committee!). The TeX engine has been used for decades to typeset professionally published books.

#### Beautiful Math

Inserting equations inline $f(x) = x^2*t_i$ or block equations

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$$

is simple and straitforward, and not buggy or slow.

## Customizing or Improving the Template

This is just a starting point, but we hope to gradually and incrementally improve and update this template and the instructions that go with it, so to help ourselves and future students easily and un-stressfully create a great looking, rule-conforming thesis.

If you would like to suggest new styles, features, elements etc. please open a new issue on the [issue page](). You are also more than welcome to fork this repository, make any changes you want, and open up a pull request (see details on [gitflow here]())
