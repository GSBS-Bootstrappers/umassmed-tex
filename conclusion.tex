High visual sensitivity is a common and important characteristic of animal eyes. It is especially critical for night vision. High visual sensitivity depends to a large extent on the high light sensitivity of photoreceptors. Two evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the light sensory organelles are indispensable for the high sensitivity of photoreceptors: the tightly organized membrane structure and the high concentration of rhodopsin in photoreceptive membrane. Our work shed light on the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of these two characteristics.
