	the intracellular pathways of ET-stimulated ET(A) and ET(B) receptors.
	By analysis of ET(A) and ET(B) receptor internalization in transfected
	Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of overexpressed betaARK,
	beta-arrestin-1, beta-arrestin-2, or dynamin as well as dominant
	negative mutants of these regulators, we have demonstrated that both

	mechanism of internalization. Fluorescence microscopy of Chinese
	hamster ovary and COS cells expressing green fluorescent protein
	(GFP)-tagged ET receptors revealed that the ET(A) and ET(B) subtypes
	were targeted to different intracellular routes after ET stimulation.
	While ET(A)-GFP followed a recycling pathway and colocalized with
	transferrin in the pericentriolar recycling compartment, ET(B)-GFP
	was targeted to lysosomes after ET-induced internalization. Both
	receptor subtypes colocalized with Rab5 in classical early endosomes,
	indicating that this compartment is a common early intermediate for
	the two ET receptors during intracellular transport. The distinct
	intracellular routes of ET-stimulated ET(A) and ET(B) receptors may
	explain the persistent signal response through the ET(A) receptor
	and the transient response through the ET(B) receptor. Furthermore,
	lysosomal targeting of the ET(B) receptor could serve as a biochemical
	mechanism for clearance of plasma endothelin via this subtype.},

  abstract = {A fundamental question in cell biology is how membrane proteins are
	sorted in the endocytic pathway. The sorting of internalized beta2-adrenergic
	receptors between recycling endosomes and lysosomes is responsible
	for opposite effects on signal transduction and is regulated by physiological
	stimuli. Here we describe a mechanism that controls this sorting
	operation, which is mediated by a family of conserved protein-interaction
	modules called PDZ domains. The phosphoprotein EBP50 (for ezrinradixin-moesin(ERM)-binding
	phosphoprotein-50) binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the beta2-adrenergic
	receptor through a PDZ domain and to the cortical actin cytoskeleton
	through an ERM-binding domain. Disrupting the interaction of EBP50
	with either domain or depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton
	itself causes missorting of endocytosed beta2-adrenergic receptors
	but does not affect the recycling of transferrin receptors. A serine
	residue at position 411 in the tail of the beta2-adrenergic receptor
	is a substrate for phosphorylation by GRK-5 (for G-protein-coupled-receptor
	kinase-5) and is required for interaction with EBP50 and for proper
	recycling of the receptor. Our results identify a new role for PDZ-domain-mediated
	protein interactions and for the actin cytoskeleton in endocytic
	sorting, and suggest a mechanism by which GRK-mediated phosphorylation
	could regulate membrane trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors

	A genetics approach to eliminate arrestin unmasked the constitutive

	did not fully prevent cell death caused by K296E. The adverse effect
	of K296E in the arrestin/transducin knock-out background can be mimicked
	by constant exposure to low light. Furthermore, we found that arrestin

	stationary night blindness caused by mutations in identified genes
	encoding proteins of photoreceptors or the retinal pigment epithelium.
	METHODS: Review of the visual acuities, visual fields, fundi, dark-adaptation
	curves, and electroretinograms from patients with stationary night
	blindness caused by mutations in the genes RHO, GNAT1, PDE6B, RHOK,
	SAG, RDH5, and CACNA1F, respectively encoding rhodopsin, the alpha
	subunit of rod transducin, the beta subunit of rod cGMP-phosphodiesterase,
	rhodopsin kinase, arrestin, 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase, and a retinal
	L-type calcium channel. RESULTS: In the evaluated forms of stationary
	night blindness, the time course of dark adaptation and the characteristics
	of the electroretinogram indicate that rod photoreceptors are present
	and that they function, although abnormally. In night blindness resulting
	from defects in rhodopsin, the alpha subunit of rod transducin, or
	the beta subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase, rod photoreceptors
	respond only to light intensities far brighter than normal, and the
	sensitivity of rods to light is similar to that of normal individuals
	who are not dark adapted. In fundus albipunctatus and in Oguchi disease,
	the rod photoreceptors can achieve normal sensitivity to dim light
	but only after 2 or more hours of dark adaptation, compared with
	approximately 0.5 hours for normal individuals. In each of these
	forms of stationary night blindness, the poor rod sensitivity and
	the time course of dark adaptation correlate with the known or presumed
	physiologic abnormalities caused by the identified gene defects.
	Patients with some forms of stationary night blindness, such as fundus
	albipunctatus and Oguchi disease, may develop degeneration of the
	retina leading to severe loss of vision in later life. CONCLUSIONS:
	The identification of the mutant genes causing forms of stationary
	night blindness refines the classification of these diseases and
	enhances our understanding of the underlying physiologic defects.
	Ophthalmologists must be aware that although these diseases are traditionally
	categorized as "stationary," some of them lead to reduced visual

  abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane proteins
	that form the largest single family of integral membrane receptors.
	GPCRs transduce information provided by extracellular stimuli into
	intracellular second messengers via their coupling to heterotrimeric
	G proteins and the subsequent regulation of a diverse variety of
	effector systems. Agonist activation of GPCRs also initiates processes
	that are involved in the feedback desensitization of GPCR responsiveness,
	the internalization of GPCRs, and the coupling of GPCRs to heterotrimeric
	G protein-independent signal transduction pathways. GPCR desensitization
	occurs as a consequence of G protein uncoupling in response to phosphorylation
	by both second messenger-dependent protein kinases and G protein-coupled
	receptor kinases (GRKs). GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation promotes
	the binding of beta-arrestins, which not only uncouple receptors
	from heterotrimeric G proteins but also target many GPCRs for internalization
	in clathrin-coated vesicles. beta-Arrestin-dependent endocytosis
	of GPCRs involves the direct interaction of the carboxyl-terminal
	tail domain of beta-arrestins with both beta-adaptin and clathrin.
	The focus of this review is the current and evolving understanding
	of the contribution of GRKs, beta-arrestins, and endocytosis to GPCR-specific
	patterns of desensitization and resensitization. In addition to their
	role as GPCR-specific endocytic adaptor proteins, beta-arrestins
	also serve as molecular scaffolds that foster the formation of alternative,
	heterotrimeric G protein-independent signal transduction complexes.
	Similar to what is observed for GPCR desensitization and resensitization,
	beta-arrestin-dependent GPCR internalization is involved in the intracellular
	compartmentalization of these protein complexes.},

	This region along with previously unidentified proteins encoded in

  abstract = {Light adaptation is a process that enables photoreceptor cells to
	operate over a wide range of light intensities without saturation.
	In invertebrate photoreceptors, fast adaptation is mediated by a
	Ca2+-dependent negative-feedback mechanism, which mainly affects
	the terminal steps of the cascade. Therefore, the response to each
	photon is smaller as light intensity increases, accommodating both
	high sensitivity and a vast dynamic range. Here, we describe a novel
	type of adaptation, which is mediated by one of the first steps in
	the phototransduction cascade affecting the sensitivity to absorbed
	photons. Long exposure to light resulted in dramatic reduction in
	the probability of each absorbed photon to elicit a response, whereas
	the size and shape of each single photon response did not change.
	To dissect the molecular mechanism underlying this form of adaptation
	we used a series of Drosophila mutants. Genetic dissection showed
	a pivotal role for light-induced translocation of Gq alpha between
	the signaling membrane and the cytosol. Biochemical studies revealed
	that the sensitivity to light depends on membrane Gq alpha concentration,
	which was modulated either by light or by mutations that impaired
	its targeting to the membrane. We conclude that long-term adaptation
	is mediated by the movement of Gq alpha from the signaling membrane
	to the cytosol, thereby reducing the probability of each photon to
	elicit a response. The slow time scale of this adaptation fits well
	with day/night light intensity changes, because there is no need
	to maintain single photon sensitivity during daytime.},

	leads to cytotoxicity, via the activation of two stress-specific
	mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38 and JNK, which are
	known to control stress-induced apoptosis. In Rh1P37H flies, visual

	Here we report that Galpha(q) signaling leads to the activation of
	ARF6. Stimulation of the TPbeta receptor triggered ARF6 activation
	which was completely inhibited by the RGS domain of GRK2 known to
	specifically bind and sequester Galpha(q). Co-immunoprecipitation

	Galpha(q) compared to non-activated Galpha(q). Formation of the Galpha(q)
	complexes with ARNO and ARF6 was detected early and was optimal after
	30 min of receptor stimulation corresponding with the profile of
	ARF6 activation. Interestingly, binding experiments using purified
	proteins showed that Galpha(q) interacted directly with ARNO. Galpha(q)-dependent
	TPbeta receptor-mediated activation of ARF6 resulted in phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
	production which was potently inhibited by dominant negative mutants

	further elucidates our previous data on the PLCbeta- and PKC-independent

	and branching. These defects are also suppressed by loss of bchs.
	Taken together, these data identify Bchs as an antagonist of Rab11

	shows homology with the C-terminal tetrapeptide (DSLL) of the beta2-adrenergic
	receptor, a motif that has been reported to mediate the recycling
	of the internalized beta2-adrenergic receptor by binding to ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continuous exposure to light, even at relatively low intensities,
	leads to retinal damage and blindness in wild-type animals. However,
	the molecular mechanisms underlying constant-light-induced blindness
	are poorly understood. It has been presumed that the visual impairment
	resulting from long-term, continuous exposure to ambient light is
	a secondary consequence of the effects of light on retinal morphology,
	but this has not been addressed. RESULTS: To characterize the mechanism
	underlying light-induced blindness, we applied a molecular genetic
	approach using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that
	the temporal loss of the photoresponse was paralleled by a gradual
	decline in the concentration of rhodopsin. The decline in rhodopsin
	and the visual response were suppressed by a C-terminal truncation
	of rhodopsin, by mutations in arrestin, and by elimination of a lysosomal
	protein, Sunglasses. Conversely, the visual impairment was greatly
	enhanced by mutation of the rhodopsin phosphatase, rdgC. Surprisingly,
	the mutations that suppressed light-induced blindness did not reduce
	the severity of the retinal degeneration resulting from constant
	light. Moreover, mutations known to suppress retinal degeneration
	did not ameliorate the light-induced blindness. CONCLUSIONS: These
	data demonstrate that the constant light-induced blindness and retinal
	degeneration result from defects in distinct molecular pathways.
	Our results support a model in which visual impairment caused by
	continuous illumination occurs through an arrestin-dependent pathway
	that promotes degradation of rhodopsin.},

	Visual function as measured by the electroretinogram was approximately

	A distinct histopathologic abnormality was the accumulation of submicrometer-sized

	segments. The extracellular vesicles were bound by a single membrane
	that apparently contained rhodopsin as revealed by ultrastructural

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To further characterize the retinas of Pro3471Leu rhodopsin
	transgenic pigs, a model for human retinitis pigmentosa. METHODS:
	Retinas from normal and transgenic pigs, newborn to 20 months old,
	were processed for light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical
	examination. RESULTS: At birth, rod numbers were normal in the transgenic
	retinas, but their outer segments were short and disorganized and
	their inner segments contained stacks of rhodopsin-positive membranes.
	The newborn rod synapses lacked synaptic vesicles and ribbons and
	had numerous rhodopsin-positive, filopodia-like processes that extended
	past the cone synapses into the outer plexiform layer. Rod cell death
	was apparent by 2 weeks and was pronounced in the mid periphery and
	central regions by 6 weeks. Far peripheral rods were initially better
	preserved, but by 9 months virtually all rods had degenerated. Cones
	degenerated more slowly than rods, but by 4 weeks the cone synapses
	were shrunken and some mid peripheral cones had lost their immunoreactivity
	for phosphodiesterase-gamma, arrestin, and recoverin. From 9 months
	to 20 months, the cone outer segments shortened progressively, and
	more cones lost immunoreactivity for these proteins. CONCLUSIONS:
	The rhodopsin transgenic pig retina shares many cytologic features
	with human retinas with retinitis pigmentosa and provides an opportunity
	to examine the earliest stages in photoreceptor degeneration, about
	which little is known in humans. The finding of abnormal rhodopsin
	localization in newborn rods is consistent with misrouting of mutant
	rhodopsin as an early process leading to rod cell death. Novel changes
	in the photoreceptor synapses may correlate with early electrophysiological
	abnormalities in these retinas.},

  abstract = {Rho family GTPases (eg., RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42) are monomeric G-proteins
	that act as key transducers of extracellular signals to the actin
	cytoskeleton. In the nervous system, Rho family GTPases are essential
	regulators of neuronal growth cone motility, axonal migration, and
	dendritic spine morphogenesis. Given these vital functions, it is
	perhaps not surprising that mutations in several proteins involved
	in Rho GTPase signaling are causative in some forms of mental retardation.
	In addition, numerous recent studies have identified Rho family GTPases
	as central players in the molecular pathways that determine neuronal
	survival and death. Interestingly, individual Rho family members
	have been shown to play either a pro-death or pro-survival role in
	the nervous system depending on both the type of neuron and the particular
	neurodegenerative insult involved. This review summarizes current
	work demonstrating a critical role for Rho family GTPases and their
	effectors in the regulation of neuronal development, survival, and
	death. These findings may be particularly relevant in the context
	of specific neurodegenerative disorders in which Rho family GTPase

	contains four ankyrin-like repeats at the C-terminal region, suggesting

	Both arrestins underwent rapid translocation (<1 min) from the cytosol

	retinal degeneration. Many gene mutations cause fly photoreceptor
	degeneration, either because of excessive stimulation of the visual
	transduction (phototransduction) cascade, or through apoptotic pathways
	that in many cases involve a visual arrestin Arr2. Here we report
	a gene named tadr (for torn and diminished rhabdomeres), which, when
	mutated, leads to photoreceptor degeneration through a different
	mechanism. Degeneration in the tadr mutant is characterized by shrunk
	and disrupted rhabdomeres, the light sensory organelles of photoreceptor.
	The TADR protein interacted in vitro with the major light receptor
	Rh1 rhodopsin, and genetic reduction of the Rh1 level suppressed
	the tadr mutation-caused degeneration, suggesting the degeneration
	is Rh1-dependent. Nonetheless, removal of phospholipase C (PLC),
	a key enzyme in phototransduction, and that of Arr2 failed to inhibit
	rhabdomeral degeneration in the tadr mutant background. Biochemical
	analyses revealed that, in the tadr mutant, the G(q) protein of Rh1
	is defective in dissociation from the membrane during light stimulation.
	Importantly, reduction of G(q) level by introducing a hypomorphic
	allele of G(alphaq) gene greatly inhibited the tadr degeneration
	phenotype. These results may suggest that loss of a potential TADR-Rh1
	interaction leads to an abnormality in the G(q) signaling, which
	in turn triggers rhabdomeral degeneration independent of the PLC
	phototransduction cascade. We propose that TADR-like proteins may
	also protect photoreceptors from degeneration in mammals including
	humans.},

	RP mutations at Lys 296, site of Schiff base linkage to the retinal

	Similarly, mutation of Ala 292-->Glu activates opsin in vitro and

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arrestins are pivotal, multifunctional organizers of cell
	responses to GPCR stimulation, including cell survival and cell death.
	In Drosophila norpA and rdgC mutants, endocytosis of abnormally stable
	complexes of rhodopsin (Rh1) and fly photoreceptor Arrestin2 (Arr2)
	triggers cell death, implicating Rh1/Arr2-bearing endosomes in pro-cell
	death signaling, potentially via arrestin-mediated GPCR activation
	of effector kinase pathways. In order to further investigate arrestin
	function in photoreceptor physiology and survival, we studied Arr2's
	partner photoreceptor arrestin, Arr1, in developing and adult Drosophila
	compound eyes. RESULTS: We report that Arr1, but not Arr2, is essential
	for normal, light-induced rhodopsin endocytosis. Also distinct from
	Arr2, Arr1 is essential for light-independent photoreceptor survival.
	Photoreceptor cell death caused by loss of Arr1 is strongly suppressed
	by coordinate loss of Arr2. We further find that Rh1 C-terminal phosphorylation
	is essential for light-induced endocytosis and also for translocation
	of Arr1, but not Arr2, from dark-adapted photoreceptor cytoplasm
	to photosensory membrane rhabdomeres. In contrast to a previous report,
	we do not find a requirement for photoreceptor myosin kinase NINAC
	in Arr1 or Arr2 translocation. CONCLUSIONS: The two Drosophila photoreceptor
	arrestins mediate distinct and essential cell pathways downstream
	of rhodopsin activation. We propose that Arr1 mediates an endocytotic
	cell-survival activity, scavenging phosphorylated rhodopsin and thereby
	countering toxic Arr2/Rh1 accumulation; elimination of toxic Arr2/Rh1
	in double mutants could thus rescue arr1 mutant photoreceptor degeneration.},

	contributes to the G protein-uncoupling of GPCRs, but also mediates
	the targeting of many GPCRs for endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits.
	Several GPCRs internalize as a stable complex with beta-arrestin

	part, whether the receptors are dephosphorylated in early endosomes

	More recently, it has become appreciated that the movement of GPCRs

  abstract = {Beta-arrestins are multifunctional adaptors that bind agonist-activated
	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediate their desensitization
	and internalization, and control the rate at which receptors recycle
	back at the plasma membrane ready for subsequent stimulation. The
	activation of the bradykinin (BK) type 2 receptor (B2R) results in
	the rapid desensitization and internalization of the receptor. Little
	is known, however, about the role of beta-arrestin in regulating
	the intracellular trafficking and the resensitization of the B2R.
	Using confocal microscopy, we show that BK stimulation of COS-7 cells
	expressing B2R induces the colocalization of the agonist-activated
	receptor with beta-arrestin into endosomes. Fluorescent imaging and
	ligand binding experiments also reveal that upon agonist removal,
	beta-arrestin rapidly dissociates from B2R into endosomes, and that
	receptors return back to the plasma membrane, fully competent for
	reactivating B2R signaling as measured by NO production upon a second
	BK challenge. However, when the receptor is mutated in its C-terminal
	domain to increase its avidity for beta-arrestin, B2R remains associated
	with beta-arrestin into endosomes, and receptors fail to recycle
	to the plasma membrane postagonist wash. Similarly, the recycling
	of receptors is prevented when a beta-arrestin mutant exhibiting
	increased avidity for agonist-bound GPCRs is expressed with B2R.
	Stabilizing receptor/beta-arrestin complexes into endosomes results
	in the dampening of the BK-mediated NO production. These results
	provide evidence for the involvement of beta-arrestin in the intracellular
	trafficking of B2R, and highlight the importance of receptor recycling
	in reestablishing B2R signaling.},

	night blindness (CSNB). Individuals with CSNB in the Rambusch pedigree
	were found to carry the H258N allele of PDE6B (MIM# 180072); a similar
	mutation was not found in RP patients. This report describes an individual
	carrying the H258N allele, who presented with generalized retinal
	dysfunction affecting the rod system and a locus of dysfunction at
	the rod-bipolar interface. Also described are preclinical studies
	in which transgenic mice with the H258N allele were generated to
	study the pathophysiological mechanisms of CSNB. While Pde6b(rd1)/Pde6b(rd1)
	mice have severe photoreceptor degeneration, as in human RP, the
	H258N transgene rescued these cells. The cGMP-PDE6 activity of dark-adapted
	H258N mice showed an approximate three-fold increase in the rate
	of retinal cGMP hydrolysis: from 130.1 nmol x min(-1) x nmol(-1)
	rhodopsin in wild-type controls to 319.2 nmol x min(-1) x nmol(-1)
	rhodopsin in mutants, consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition
	of the PDE6beta activity by the regulatory PDE6gamma subunit is blocked
	by this mutation. In the albino (B6CBA x FVB) F2 hybrid background,
	electroretinograms (ERG) from H258N mice were similar to those obtained

	selective reduction in b-wave amplitudes; rather a- and b-wave amplitudes
	were both reduced. Thus, factors other than the PDE6B mutation itself
	could contribute to the variance of an electrophysiological response.
	Therefore, caution is advisable when interpreting physiological phenotypes
	associated with the same allele on different genetic backgrounds.

	However, the impact of specifically altering TRP channel function
	is not known because existing loss-of-function alleles greatly reduce

	of a set of new trp alleles, including trp(14) with an amino acid
	substitution juxtaposed to the TRP domain. The trp(14) flies stably
	express TRP and display normal molecular anchoring, but defective
	channel function. Elimination of the anchoring function alone in
	trp(Delta)(1272), had minor effects on retinal morphology whereas
	disruption of channel function caused profound light-induced cell
	death. This retinal degeneration was greatly suppressed by elimination
	of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, CalX, indicating that the cell death
	was due primarily to deficient Ca(2+) entry rather than disruption
	of the TRP-anchoring function.},

  abstract = {Drosophila visual transduction is the fastest known G-protein-coupled
	signaling cascade and has therefore served as a genetically tractable
	animal model for characterizing rapid responses to sensory stimulation.
	Mutations in over 30 genes have been identified, which affect activation,
	adaptation, or termination of the photoresponse. Based on analyses
	of these genes, a model for phototransduction has emerged, which
	involves phosphoinoside signaling and culminates with opening of
	the TRP and TRPL cation channels. Many of the proteins that function
	in phototransduction are coupled to the PDZ containing scaffold protein
	INAD and form a supramolecular signaling complex, the signalplex.
	Arrestin, TRPL, and G alpha(q) undergo dynamic light-dependent trafficking,
	and these movements function in long-term adaptation. Other proteins
	play important roles either in the formation or maturation of rhodopsin,
	or in regeneration of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),
	which is required for the photoresponse. Mutation of nearly any gene
	that functions in the photoresponse results in retinal degeneration.
	The underlying bases of photoreceptor cell death are diverse and
	involve mechanisms such as excessive endocytosis of rhodopsin due
	to stable rhodopsin/arrestin complexes and abnormally low or high
	levels of Ca2+. Drosophila visual transduction appears to have particular
	relevance to the cascade in the intrinsically photosensitive retinal
	ganglion cells in mammals, as the photoresponse in these latter cells
	appears to operate through a remarkably similar mechanism.},

	Current strategies for gene therapy have been devised to deal with

	blindness due to malfunction of the rod photoreceptor mechanism.
	Patients with this disease show a distinctive golden-brown colour
	of the fundus that occurs as the retina adapts to light, called the
	Mizuo phenomenon. Recently a defect in arrestin, a member of the
	rod phototransduction pathway, was found to cause this disease in

	shutting off rhodopsin after it has been activated by a photon of

	might be caused by defects in rhodopsin kinase. This report describes
	an analysis of the arrestin and rhodopsin kinase genes in three unrelated
	cases of Oguchi disease. No defects in arrestin were detected, but
	all three cases had mutations in the rhodopsin kinase gene. Two cases
	were found to be homozygous for a deletion encompassing exon 5, predicted
	to lead to a nonfunctional protein. The third case was a compound
	heterozygote with two allelic mutations, a missense mutation (Val380Asp)
	affecting a residue in the catalytic domain, and a frameshift mutation
	(Ser536(4-bp del)) resulting in truncation of the carboxy terminus.

	We report herein a new mutant, Trp(P365), that does not display the

	substantial level of the TRP protein and rapid, semi-dominant degeneration

	in a Trp(P365) background suppresses the mutant phenotype. Moreover,
	amino acid alterations that could cause the Trp(P365) phenotype are

	Whole-cell recordings clarified the mechanism underlying the retinal
	degeneration by showing that the TRP channels of Trp(P365) are constitutively

	photoreceptors leads to activation of a cGMP-phosphodiesterase effector
	and the generation of a hyperpolarizing response. In contrast, activation
	of invertebrate photoreceptors, like Drosophila, leads to stimulation
	of phospholipase C and the generation of a depolarizing receptor
	potential. The comparative study of these two systems of phototransduction
	offers the opportunity to understand how similar biological problems
	may be solved by different molecular mechanisms of signal transduction.
	The study of this process in Drosophila, a system ideally suited
	to genetic and molecular manipulation, allows us to dissect the function
	and regulation of such a complex signaling cascade in its normal
	cellular environment. In this manuscript I review some of our recent
	findings and the strategies used to dissect this process.},
