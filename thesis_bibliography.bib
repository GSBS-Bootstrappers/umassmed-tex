  abstract = {Although many different mutations in humans and Drosophila cause retinal
	degeneration, in most cases, a molecular mechanism for the degeneration
	has not been found. We now demonstrate the existence of stable, persistent
	complexes between rhodopsin and its regulatory protein arrestin in
	several different retinal degeneration mutants. Elimination of these
	rhodopsin-arrestin complexes by removing either rhodopsin or arrestin
	rescues the degeneration phenotype. Furthermore, we show that the
	accumulation of these complexes triggers apoptotic cell death and
	that the observed retinal degeneration requires the endocytic machinery.
	This suggests that the endocytosis of rhodopsin-arrestin complexes
	is a molecular mechanism for the initiation of retinal degeneration.
	We propose that an identical mechanism may be responsible for the
	pathology found in a subset of human retinal degenerative disorders.},

  abstract = {Among many achievements in the neurodegeneration field in the past
	decade, two require special attention due to the huge impact on our
	understanding of molecular and cellular pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative
	diseases. First is defining specific mutations in familial neurodegenerative
	diseases and second is modeling these diseases in easily manipulable
	model organisms including the fruit fly, nematode, and yeast. The
	power of these genetic systems has revealed many genetic factors
	involved in the various pathways affected, as well as provided potential
	drug targets for therapeutics. This review focuses on fruit fly models
	of human neurodegenerative diseases, with emphasis on how fly models
	have provided new insights into various aspects of human diseases.},

  abstract = {To identify the full set of genes expressed by mammalian rods, we
	conducted serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) by using libraries
	generated from mature and developing mouse retina. We identified
	264 uncharacterized genes that were specific to or highly enriched
	in rods. Nearly half of all cloned human retinal disease genes are
	selectively expressed in rod photoreceptors. In silico mapping of
	the human orthologs of genes identified in our screen revealed that
	86 map within intervals containing uncloned retinal disease genes,
	representing 37 different loci. We expect these data will allow identification
	of many disease genes, and that this approach may be useful for cloning
	genes involved in classes of disease where cell type-specific expression
	of disease genes is observed.},

  abstract = {Severe norpA mutations in Drosophila eliminate the photoreceptor potential
	and render the fly completely blind. Recent biochemical analyses
	have shown that norpA mutants lack phospholipase C (PLC) activity
	in the eye. A combination of chromosomal walking and transposon-mediated
	mutagenesis was used to clone the norpA gene. This gene encodes a
	7.5 kb RNA that is expressed in the adult head. In situ hybridizations
	of norpA cDNA to adult tissue sections show that this gene is expressed
	abundantly in the retina. The putative norpA protein is composed
	of 1095 amino acid residues and has extensive sequence similarity
	to a PLC amino acid sequence from bovine brain. We suggest that the
	norpA gene encodes a PLC expressed in the eye of Drosophila and that
	PLC is an essential component of the Drosophila phototransduction
	pathway.},
